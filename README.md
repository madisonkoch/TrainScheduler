# TrainScheduler

#### Problem

Some of the XYZ Train Company's employees aren't very good at math and keep messing up the next arrival times of the scheduled trains.

#### Components

This webpage uses Firebase for employees to submit information about trains, have the information stored and have it be accessable by other employees.

#### Description

As an employee, all you have to do is enter the train's information (i.e. name, destination, first arrival time and frequency). The webiste will calculate the train's next arrival and how many minutes until it's next arrival.
